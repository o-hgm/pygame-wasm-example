Personal notes on Python and WebAssembly.

## Getting Started

## Background

### WebAssembly

[WebAssembly][1] is:

A new type of code that can be run in modern web browsers and provides new features and major gains in performance. It is not primarily intended to be written by hand, rather it is designed to be an effective compilation target for source languages like C, C++, Rust, etc.
